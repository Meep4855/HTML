        <p>3D printing is based of a method called "photopolymerization" (This is when a liquid, is used to make a model that a computer gives it. It is constructed by layers and harden by a ultraviolet light) called "stereolithography" (a form of 3d printing technology that is used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts by layer.) You are gonna need a 3D model of what you are gonna print on either a USB or on a computer, that the 3D printer can read.</p>
        <p>A few things to keep in mind before starting a new print</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure the bed of the printer is level and secured. This can cause the bed to move and may cause mis prints</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply an adhesive. If you forget to apply the adhesive there is a chance you material might move around while printing.</li>
            <li>Also make sure you have enough of the materials you need to print.</li>
        </ol>
