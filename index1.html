            <h1 id="history">History Of 3D Printing.</h1>
            <p>During 1981 Hideo Kodama from the  Nagoya Municipal Industrial research institute, had released his notes about away to quickly make prototype using photopolymerization (This is when a liquid, is used to make a model that a computer gives it. It is constructed by layers and harden by a ultraviolet light). In 1984 Charles Hull built upon Hideo Kodama notes and created something stereolithography(a form of 3d printing technology that is used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts by layer.) In 1992  Charles Hull was able to make a a machine that let people print complicated parts.There giving the birth to 3D printing.</p>

            <h1 id="works">How It Works</h1>
            <p>3D printing is based of a method called "photopolymerization" (This is when a liquid, is used to make a model that a computer gives it. It is constructed by layers and harden by a ultraviolet light) called "stereolithography" (a form of 3d printing technology that is used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts by layer.)</p>
            <p>You are gonna need a 3D model of what you are gonna print on either a USB or on a computer, that the 3D printer can read.</p>
            <p>A few things to keep in mind before starting a new print</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure the bed of the printer is level and secured. This can cause the bed to move and may cause mis prints</li>
                <li>Make sure you apply an adhesive. If you forget to apply the adhesive there is a chance you material might move around while printing.</li>
                <li>Also make sure you have enough of the materials you need to print.</li>

            <h1 id="the">Why We 3D Print and The Future Of 3D Printing</h1>
            <p>In today's age there are many reasons why we use 3D printers. With the rise of 3D printing, you see some company's using less assembly lines to make parts, and instead companies just now 3D print these parts. 3D printers are starting to be used in schools to teach students how to 3D model for architecture, or even being used to show students DNA. They aer even being used in the medical field to print prosthetic lims.</p>
            <p>This all starts to pose the question of what is the future of 3D printing. Know with 3D printers coming closer to be able to print full metal parts the potential seems endless. They are even trying to make rocket ships made out of fully 3D printed parts.</p>
