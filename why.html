            <h1 id="the">Why We 3D Print and The Future Of 3D Printing</h1>
            <p>In today's age there are many reasons why we use 3D printers. With the rise of 3D printing, you see some company's using less assembly lines to make parts, and instead companies just now 3D print these parts. 3D printers are starting to be used in schools to teach students how to 3D model for architecture, or even being used to show students DNA. They aer even being used in the medical field to print prosthetic lims.</p>
            <p>This all starts to pose the question of what is the future of 3D printing. Know with 3D printers coming closer to be able to print full metal parts the potential seems endless. They are even trying to make rocket ships made out of fully 3D printed parts.</p>
